To run this file on your machine you will need to mimic a CS50 codespace. This can be done easily by following these directions. A file that simulates a formatted sd card is included in this folder for demonstration purposes, but you can subtitute it with your own.

1) Download CS50’s latest .devcontainer.json file from https://cs50.dev/.devcontainer.json, saving it in foo. Because the file’s name starts with a dot (i.e., period), it might seem to “disappear” when you download it. But, in a terminal window on Linux or macOS, you should see it with ls -a, and at a command prompt in Windows, you should see it with dir /a.

2) Download, install, and start Docker on your computer.

3) Download and install VS Code itself on your computer.

4) Install VS Code’s Dev Containers extension.

5) Open VS Code’s command palette, as via Ctrl+Shift+P on Linux, ⇧⌘P on macOS, and Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows, select >Dev Containers - Open Folder in Container…, and open foo.
